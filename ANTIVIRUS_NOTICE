# ⚠️ Antivirus & Administrator Permissions Notice

## 🛡️ Why Antivirus Might Flag MyLauncher
MyLauncher is a small, custom-built project — **not a signed, commercial application**.  
Some antivirus programs (especially Windows Defender SmartScreen) can **mistake unsigned installers** for potential threats because they haven't been verified by a trusted certificate authority.

**Important:**  
- This is called a *false positive*.  
- MyLauncher does **not** contain viruses, spyware, or malicious code.  
- The warning happens simply because the installer is new and not widely downloaded.

---

## 🔧 Why You Might Need to Disable Antivirus Temporarily
- Certain antivirus tools may **block the installer from running** or **delete files during installation**.  
- This can break the setup process or cause MyLauncher to not work properly.

**If this happens:**
1. Temporarily **pause or disable** your antivirus software.
2. Install MyLauncher.
3. **Re-enable your antivirus** after installation is complete.

## 👑 Why You Should Run as Administrator
MyLauncher needs to:
- Create folders in protected locations.
- Write configuration files for all users.
- Install dependencies required for it to function.

Running the installer as **Administrator** ensures:
- All files are installed correctly.
- No permission errors occur during setup.

## ✅ Summary
- Antivirus may flag MyLauncher because it’s unsigned, not because it’s harmful.
- Disabling antivirus temporarily can prevent installation issues.
- Running as administrator ensures a smooth setup.

> **Reminder:** Always re-enable your antivirus after installation is complete.
